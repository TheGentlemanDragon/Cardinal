‚óè Based on my thorough analysis of your Cardinal app, here are my recommendations for improvement:

üîß Code Quality & Architecture

1. Complete TODOs and Fix Known Issues

- Convert form inputs to proper <fieldset> elements in modals (src/features/\*/CreateTemplateModal.tsx)
- Implement user library and existing user check in signUp.ts:116
- Address element naming improvements noted in TODO.md

2. Add Input Validation & Error Handling

- Properties menu inputs lack validation and change handlers (PropertiesMenu.tsx:11-78)
- Form submissions need proper error states and loading indicators
- Add Zod validation for user inputs beyond database models

3. Improve State Management

- Properties menu doesn't persist changes to element properties
- Consider implementing proper form state management for the editor
- Add optimistic updates for better UX

üöÄ Performance & Technical

1. Add Linting and Type Checking

- Set up ESLint configuration (only has basic preact config in package.json)
- Add npm run lint and npm run typecheck scripts
- Consider pre-commit hooks for code quality

2. Optimize Bundle Size

- Implement code splitting for routes (already using lazy loading - good!)
- Consider tree-shaking unused TailwindCSS classes
- Analyze bundle with npm run build and check dist/ size

3. Add Testing Infrastructure

- No tests found - add Vitest or similar testing framework
- Unit tests for utilities, components, and business logic
- E2E tests for critical user flows

üé® User Experience

1. Editor Improvements

- Add visual feedback for element selection and drag/drop
- Implement undo/redo functionality
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Element reordering/layering controls

2. Better Error States

- Add proper loading states for all async operations
- Improve empty states with actionable guidance
- Add connection error handling for PocketBase

3. Mobile Responsiveness

- Editor layout uses fixed grid (grid-cols-[18rem_1fr_18rem]) - not mobile friendly
- Consider responsive design for template editing on tablets

üõ† Development Experience

1. Environment Management

- Add .env.example file documenting required environment variables
- Consider environment-specific configurations
- Add development vs production PocketBase URL handling

2. Documentation

- Add component documentation/Storybook
- Document API patterns and data flow
- Add contributing guidelines

üîí Security & Best Practices

1. Input Sanitization

- Sanitize user-generated content in templates
- Validate file uploads if images are supported
- Add rate limiting for API calls

2. Error Information Leakage

- Review error messages to avoid exposing sensitive information
- Implement proper error boundaries

üìä Monitoring & Analytics

1. Add Error Tracking

- Integrate error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- Add performance monitoring
- Consider user analytics for feature usage

2. Developer Tools

- Add better development debugging tools
- Consider adding a development mode indicator

üéØ Priority Recommendations

High Priority:

1. Fix the properties menu to actually update element properties
2. Add proper form validation and error handling
3. Set up linting/type checking
4. Complete existing TODOs

Medium Priority:

1. Add testing infrastructure
2. Improve mobile responsiveness
3. Add proper error boundaries and loading states

Low Priority:

1. Bundle optimization
2. Advanced editor features (undo/redo, shortcuts)
3. Monitoring and analytics

Your app has a solid foundation with good architecture choices (Preact + Signals, PocketBase, TanStack Query). The main
areas for improvement are completing the interactive features, adding robustness through testing/validation, and
enhancing the user experience.
