‚óè Based on <ClaudeCode> analysis, here are the main issues that could significantly hinder performance or maintainability:

Critical Issues

1. TypeScript Safety Problems - Multiple @ts-expect-error suppressions and unsafe type assertions that could lead to runtime errors
2. 220KB of Dead Code - The \_old/ directory contains legacy React code that should be removed
3. Performance Anti-patterns - Missing memoization, direct DOM manipulation, and manual query refetching instead of optimistic updates
4. Configuration Security - Hardcoded IP addresses in tracked config files instead of environment variables

Maintainability Concerns

1. Inconsistent Patterns - Different validation patterns, and manual modal management
2. Poor Error Handling - Generic error boundaries without user-friendly messages
3. Code Quality Issues - Console statements in production, commented code, and incomplete TODO implementations

Scalability Blockers

1. No Component-level Code Splitting - Could lead to large bundle sizes as the app grows
2. Missing Key Props - Could cause React reconciliation issues with large lists
3. Unsafe localStorage Access - No error handling for malformed JSON

The codebase has good architectural foundations but needs attention to TypeScript safety, performance optimization, and code consistency to scale effectively.
